# Unit2_Titanic_Group9

## Project Overview
This project explores predictive modeling using BigQuery ML (BQML) on the **Titanic dataset**. The objective was to build and evaluate models that estimate passenger survival probability using logistic regression, both in a simple baseline form and with additional engineered features.  
Each team member created an individual model variant, and together, we analyzed performance, interpretability, and operational trade-offs across thresholds.

## Business Question
Can we accurately predict whether a passenger would survive the Titanic disaster based on manifest-level features such as class, sex, age, fare, and embarkation port?

## Dataset
**Source:** `bigquery-public-data.ml_datasets.titanic`  
**Features used:**  
- Pclass  
- Sex  
- Age  
- Fare  
- Embarked  
- (Engineered features in later models: Family size, Fare bucket, Sex–Class interaction)
